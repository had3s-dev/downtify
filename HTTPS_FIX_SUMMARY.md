# HTTPS Mixed Content Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing a mixed content error where the HTTPS page was trying to make HTTP requests to the `/download-web/` endpoint, causing the browser to block the request.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Form action using a relative URL that could be interpreted as HTTP in some cases
2. Missing security headers to enforce HTTPS
3. No Content Security Policy to prevent mixed content

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Form Action
- **File**: `templates/index.html`
- **Change**: Updated form action from `/download-web` to `/download-web/` (added trailing slash)
- **Reason**: Ensures consistent endpoint matching

### 2. Added Security Middleware
- **File**: `main.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `SecurityMiddleware` class to handle HTTPS redirects
  - Added security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Added Content Security Policy header to prevent mixed content
  - Force HTTPS redirects in production environment

### 3. Added Content Security Policy Meta Tag
- **Files**: `templates/index.html`, `templates/list.html`
- **Change**: Added `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests">`
- **Reason**: Tells the browser to automatically upgrade HTTP requests to HTTPS

### 4. Updated Railway Configuration
- **File**: `railway.json`
- **Change**: Added `FORCE_HTTPS: "true"` environment variable
- **Reason**: Enables HTTPS enforcement in Railway deployment

## Security Headers Added
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Prevents mixed content and defines allowed resources

## Content Security Policy
The CSP header allows:
- Scripts from `'self'`, `'unsafe-inline'`, `https://unpkg.com`, `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`
- Styles from `'self'`, `'unsafe-inline'`, `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com`
- Images from `'self'`, `data:`, `https:`
- Fonts from `'self'`, `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com`
- Connections to `'self'`, `https:`

## Testing
A test script `test_https_fix.py` has been created to verify:
- Security middleware is properly configured
- Form action uses correct endpoint
- Environment variables are set correctly

## Deployment
After deploying these changes:
1. The application will automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
2. Mixed content errors will be prevented
3. Security headers will be properly set
4. The form submission will work correctly over HTTPS

## Files Modified
- `main.py` - Added security middleware and HTTPS enforcement
- `templates/index.html` - Fixed form action and added CSP meta tag
- `templates/list.html` - Added CSP meta tag
- `railway.json` - Added FORCE_HTTPS environment variable
- `test_https_fix.py` - Created test script (new file)

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
1. Deploy the updated code to Railway
2. Access the site via HTTPS
3. Try submitting the download form
4. Check browser console for any mixed content errors
5. Verify that all requests are made over HTTPS
